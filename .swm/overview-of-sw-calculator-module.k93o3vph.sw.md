# Introduction to SW Calculator

The SW Calculator is a module designed to manage the bill calculation for registered sewerage service connections. It calculates sewerage charges and taxes based on predefined billing slabs.

# Scheduler for Non-Metered Connections

The module includes a scheduler for generating demands for non-metered connections. This ensures that demands are generated periodically without manual intervention.

# APIs for Estimation and Calculation

The SW Calculator provides APIs for estimating charges, calculating demands, updating demands, scheduling jobs, and applying ad-hoc taxes. These APIs facilitate integration with other systems and enable automated billing processes.

# Kafka Integration

Kafka consumers and producers are used to handle notifications and demand generation events. This ensures real-time processing and communication between different components of the system.
