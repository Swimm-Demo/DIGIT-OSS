# Overview

User Role refers to the specific permissions and access rights assigned to a user within the system. Roles are defined in MDMS masters and can be assigned to users, allowing them to hold multiple roles simultaneously.

# Role Definition

The <SwmToken path="municipal-services/ws-calculator/src/main/java/org/egov/wscalculation/web/models/Role.java" pos="14:11:11" line-data=" * this to have more role related attributes">`role`</SwmToken> class defines the structure of a role, including its name, code, and description. This class is used to represent roles within the system and is carried along in <SwmToken path="municipal-services/ws-calculator/src/main/java/org/egov/wscalculation/web/models/Role.java" pos="13:3:3" line-data=" * UserInfo with RequestInfo meta data.

# Role-Action Mapping

Role actions are mappings between Actions and Roles. Based on Role-Action mapping, the access control service identifies applicable actions for a role. This ensures that users can only perform actions they are authorized for.

# Main Functions

There are several main functions related to roles and role-actions. These include defining roles, assigning roles to users, and mapping roles to actions.

# Role-Action

Role actions are mappings between Actions and Roles. Based on Role-Action mapping, the access control service identifies applicable actions for a role. This ensures that users can only perform actions they are authorized for. The Role-Action mapping is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the system by enforcing proper access controls.
