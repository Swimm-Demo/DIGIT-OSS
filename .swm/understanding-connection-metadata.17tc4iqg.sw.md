# Connection Metadata Overview

Connection metadata refers to the various attributes and metadata associated with a connection object. These details include identifiers, statuses, and additional information necessary for managing connections.

# Connection Class

The `Connection` class defines various fields to store and manage data related to a connection. These fields include identifiers, tenant information, property details, application numbers, statuses, and various other attributes.

The `Connection` class includes fields such as `id`, `tenantId`, `propertyId`, `applicationNo`, `applicationStatus`, `status`, `connectionNo`, `oldConnectionNo`, `documents`, `plumberInfo`, `roadType`, `roadCuttingArea`, `roadCuttingInfo`, `connectionExecutionDate`, `connectionCategory`, `connectionType`, `additionalDetails`, `auditDetails`, `processInstance`, `applicationType`, `dateEffectiveFrom`, `connectionHolders`, and `disconnectionExecutionDate`.

```java
public class Connection {
	@JsonProperty("id")
	private String id = null;

	@JsonProperty("tenantId")
	private String tenantId = null;

	@JsonProperty("propertyId")
	private String propertyId = null;

	@JsonProperty("applicationNo")
	private String applicationNo = null;


	@JsonProperty("applicationStatus")
	private String applicationStatus = null;

	/**
	 * Gets or Sets status
	 */
	public enum StatusEnum {
```

# Additional Details

The `additionalDetails` field is used to capture any extra information that is not accommodated by the standard model. This allows for flexibility in storing additional data as needed.

The `additionalDetails` field is defined in the `Connection` class to store extra information.

```java
	@JsonProperty("additionalDetails")
	private Object additionalDetails = null;
```
